### Video demonstration of the project

### Introduction
During my algorithms course, I found it really difficult to understand how a particular algorithm worked if there wasn't some kind of visual example. So after the semester ended, I decided to create a project where you can build up and operate a variety of data structures and actually see what is going on behind all that confusing code. I am planning on adding most of the data structures that I encountered during the course but for now just the binary search tree is fully implemented.

### Technology used
The code is 100% python, with the graphical portion of the application using PySimpleGUI.

### Usage
#### Binary Search Tree
The binary search tree supports insert, search, delete, preorder, inorder and postorder traversals along with breadth first search.
